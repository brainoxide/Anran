[10.00:15.00]Somewhere down the road, past the neon glow,
[16.00:19.00]There’s a place where time won’t go.
[20.00:24.00]Step inside. But if you ask me,
[24.00:29.00]You won’t leave quite the way you think…
[30.50:33.00]The pink coat fades under moonlight glow,
[33.00:35.00]too bright, too sharp, like it already knows.
[33.00:38.00]She’s waiting there, looking right at me,
[38.60:41.00]but no—not really.
Just pick a door, any door at all,
but you never told me where they le words had changed,
or maybe it was me all along...
Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
one turned back, one took the road.
Ask me now, but I don't know—
Where did the third bull go?
Cards on the table, hand on my glass,
thought I was early, but the time don’t match.
She traced a circle... round and round,
like she knew something I hadn’t found.
The Cheshire cat smile, wide and thin,
twists and shifts, but it still lets me in.
The laughter moves like waves on sand,
but it never quite reaches where I stand.
Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
one turned back, one took the road.
Ask me now, I think that I know—
the third bull never left, the third bull never left.
Checked my phone, message unread,
or maybe unsent, or maybe misled.
Tried the door, tried the road,
but something kept pulling, something old.
She turned to leave, she turned to stay—
if you ask me, it’s all the same.
I chased a door I never walked through,
and found the moon staring back like it knew.
Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
one turned back, one took the road.
Ask me now, but I already know—
the third bull never left, the third bull never left.
Somewhere down the road, past the neon glow,
There’s a place where time won’t go…
