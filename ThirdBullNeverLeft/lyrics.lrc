[00:00.00]...intro...
[00:10.00]Somewhere down the road, past the neon glow,
[00:16.00]There’s a place where time won’t go.
[00:20.00]Step inside. But if you ask me,
[00:24.00]You won’t leave quite the way you think…
[00:30.50]The pink coat fades under moonlight glow,
[00:33.00]Too bright, too sharp, like it already knows.
[00:35.50]She’s waiting there, looking right at me,
[00:38.60]But no, not really.
[00:45.20]Just pick a door, any door at all,
[00:48.20]but you never told me where they led

[00:55.50]The jukebox played an old reframe, but the words had changed,
[01:00.00]or maybe it was me all along...
[01:04.00]Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
[01:08.50]one turned back, one took the road.
[01:14.00]Ask me now, but I don't know—
[01:18.00]Where did the third bull go?
[01:23.00]...
[01:34.00]Cards on the table, hand on my glass,
[01:38.50]thought I was early, but the time don’t match.
[01:44.00]She traced a circle... round and round,
[01:49.00]like she knew something I hadn’t found.
[01:54.00]The Cheshire cat smile, wide and thin,
[01:59.00]twists and shifts, but it still lets me in.
[02:04.00]The laughter moves like waves on sand,
[02:09.00]but it never quite reaches where I stand.
[02:14.00]Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
[02:19.00]one turned back, one took the road.
[02:24.00]Ask me now, I think that I know—
[02:29.00]the third bull never left, the third bull never left.
[02:34.00]Checked my phone, message unread,
[02:36.50]or maybe unsent, or maybe misled.
[02:39.80]Tried the door, tried the road,
[02:40.00]but something kept pulling, something old.
[02:44.00]She turned to leave, she turned to stay—
[02:47.00]if you ask me, it’s all the same.
[02:49.80]I chased a door I never walked through,
[02:52.00]and found the moon staring back like it knew.
[02:57.00]Three bulls stood at the old crossroad,
[03:02.00]one turned back, one took the road.
[03:07.00]Ask me now, but I already know—
[03:12.00]the third bull never left, the third bull never left.
[03:17.00]Somewhere down the road, past the neon glow,
[03:23.00]There’s a place where time won’t go…
